  The user can select which one of the four response-generating engines they would like to utilize. 
  It has a very nice and a clean layout with a number of animations.

  description: `The Yoga Vision project was created during a short hackathon of only about 10 hours. 
          I worked with a team of 5 other individuals. In this project, 
          we utilized the Media Pipe Post API to analyze an individual's yoga pose 
          and created a website to contain this core feature. 
          The central portion of the project was setting up the API correctly to 
          receive live input of the individual limb coordinates and then run calculations 
          and output a score based on alignment with our demo poses. 
          My main contribution was identifying how to hook into the API 
          and identify the mathematical calculations necessary for collecting the score. 
          The score was calculated based on observing an individual's angular distance from 
          three points and comparing that angle with our demo. 
          The project won first place in the hackathon!`,
